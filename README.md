The project begins on the Guest player screen. The game starts once you begin guessing points on your opponents board. To Register or Log in, click the Register/Log In button in the top right of the Navigation bar. This will redirect you to the registration page where you can either create a new account, or log into an existing one. Once logged in, the game page will display the number of the current user's previous wins and losses, and the navigation bar should now have an option to "Logout".
